## 🚀 Project Overview

The **House Price Prediction** system allows users to enter key details about a house—such as built-up area, number of floors, bathrooms, garden availability, and furnishing status—and receive an estimated house price based on a trained regression model.

This project focuses on:
- Practical application of **machine learning regression**
- Clean **data preprocessing**
- Model integration with a **web-based UI**
- Understanding real-world ML deployment basics
